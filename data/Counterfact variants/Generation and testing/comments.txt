1. relations_dicts.pkl contains the following dictionaries:
original_relations has been collected from counterfact by collecting the prompts used in the edit requests for each relation.
problem_relations are removed
good_relations are kept as is
corrected_relations are kept after replacing some prompts
for each relation in corrected_relations, translations contains a dictionary translating old prompts to new prompts
2. counterfact_convertor_to_tf.py takes counterfact.json, and creates curated_counterfact.json, counterfact_true.json
and counterfact_false.json
3. test_model_on_cftcff.py take counterfact_true.json or counterfact_false.json and runs it through vicuna-7b to calculate
the probabilities of True and False outputs.
4. check_threshold_breakdown.py computes the probability that the correct answer croesses a correctness threshold, prob_sum.py
computes the probability of acceptable output format (either true or false).
